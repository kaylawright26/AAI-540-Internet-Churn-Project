# AAI-540-Internet-Churn-Project
AAI 540 ML Ops Final Project Repository

This project is part of the AAI-540 ML Ops course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego.

This project is completed as of 3/4/2024

This project aimed to detect churned customers from an internet service provider and create an end-to-end ML system within AWS. The data source is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmetsabrikunt/internet-service-churn. Our goal was to acurately detect if a customer is at risk of churning from an Internet service provider in a simulated real time pipeline. 

This repository contains code for EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling(logistic regression and XGBoost), model monitoring, and CI/CD.
